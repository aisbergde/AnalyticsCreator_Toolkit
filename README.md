Tools for working with AnalyticsCreator and its project repositories

AnalyticsCreator stores all project data in project repositories. These are SQL databases. The manufacturer explicitly encourages you to work directly with the repository databases. In this project tools will be provided to extend the work with AnalyticsCreator. These can be simple data for macros or scripts, or extensions for the repositories with prepared views, procedures, supplementary tables.
